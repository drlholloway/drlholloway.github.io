## About

Professionally, I have many years of industry experience as a developer using a variety of languages, team lead, architect, and mentor. I enjoy working with teams and helping them understand how their work fits into the larger ecosystem and how important they are in the finished product. I also recognize that learning is a continuous process that means helping employees see areas where they can grow and make them a stronger asset for the company and themselves. Finally, I understand that developing software programs requires procedures for maintaining product integrity that can allow for easy expansion and changes as requirements are refined.

Academically, I'm a PhD from The University of Texas at Austin. My research applies formal verification methods to interactive stories(think video games). By rethinking the problem I have shown that we can prevent inconsistencies between the stories and their virtual worlds which will facilitate a new level of immersion in the media.
